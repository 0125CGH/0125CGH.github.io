      <h2>Interests</h2>
      <p>
      I am interested in all software development related opportunities (contact info at the bottom). Outside of tech, I enjoy hiking, biking, reading, exploring different kinds of music, exercising, traveling, and learning new things.
      <br></br>

      <h1>Experience</h1>

      <h2><a href="http://civisanalytics.com/" target="_blank">Civis Analytics</a></h2>
      <p>
      This past summer, I was at Civis Analytics in Chicago. I learned a lot of new things, from Ruby and Rails, to Angular.js, as well as good software development practices. At Civis, my
      project was all about instrumentation. I wrote a StatsD library for the Rails app, created a corresponding Docker image for easy deployment, and decided on architectural decisions as
      well as backends for StatsD. I then collected key metrics with the library in the Rails application and analyzed it using queuing theory and machine learning techniques. Finally, I
      wrote documentation in the form of a wiki to explain collecting stats as well as using stats. I also spent a busy week in the middle of the internship helping rewrite the main website
      to be ready for launch (and learning Jekyll along the way).
      <br></br>
      </p>

      <h2><a href="http://www.mitre.org/" target="_blank">MITRE</a></h2>
      <p>
      Last year, I spent the summer at MITRE. I improved an image processing and quality analysis C program for usability and efficiency while working with end users to write program
      documentation. Additionally, I also learned FORTRAN in order to convert other legacy programs into C for better portability.
      <br></br>
      </p>

      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>
      For the fall semester of my sophomore year, I researched for <a href="http://www3.nd.edu/~flynn/" target="_blank">Dr. Patrick Flynn</a>. I was responsible for learning the Android
      environment and an API for iris processing in order to develop an app that does iris recognition through a special infrared camera. I learned quite a bit about biometrics and Android
      development, which have been important in getting an internship as a biometric engineer at MITRE and for some other projects of mine.

      <p class="firstpara">
      Below are some of my activities.
      <br></br>
      </p>

      <h2>Peer Advisor</h2>
      <p>
      As a peer advisor with the College of Engineering, I help mentor first year students as they navigate the engineering curriculum and explore their interests.
      Further, I also help their adjustment to life as a college student in general.
      <br></br>
      </p>

      <h2>IrishHacks</h2>
      <p>
      I am working on a team to bring a full scale hackathon to Notre Dame for fall 2015. There is work to be done on many fronts, from web development to
      logistics. Check out our website <a href="http://irishhacks.org/" target="_blank">here</a> (and register for more information).
      <br></br>
      </p>

      <h2><a href="http://fys.nd.edu/fys-resources/the-learning-resource-center/" target="_blank">Learning Resource Center Tutor</a></h2>
      <p>
      I am a tutor at the Learning Resource Center at Notre Dame and have tutored Introduction to Chemistry and Physics I. I have enjoyed tutoring since high school
      because it challenges the tutor to look at the subject from another perspective in order to explain it effectively to the student. At the LRC, I am responsible
      for teaching and reinforcing class material, as well as teaching good study habits.
      <br></br>
      </p>

      <h2>Multicultural and Web Page Commissioner</h2>
      <p>
      As the web page commissioner for my dorm, I was responsible for maintaining and updating the website. As the multicultural commissioner, I promoted cultural diversity within the dorm by
      hosting multicultural events (for example, a visit to Father Hesburgh, the former president of the University), and by raising awareness of events on campus. The redesign of the website
      may be found <a href="http://www.alexmwu.me/siegfriedwebsite/" target="_blank">here</a>. I was trying to learn Bootstrap at the time, so it made sense to use it as a framework.
      <br></br>
      </p>

      <h2>Investment Club</h2>
      <p>
      My interest in finance arose from my work with <a href="http://www.youthaboutbusiness.org/">Youth About Business</a>. This club links students with financial competitions and also has
      lectures on various trading techniques. I especially have an interest in algorithmic trading and am exploring that with <a href="http://quantopian.com/" target="_blank">Quantopian</a>.
      <br><br>
      </p>

      <h2>Summer Service Learning Program</h2>
      <p>
      The summer following my first year, I participated in a volunteering opportunity through Notre Dame. The Summer Service Learning Program (SSLP) allows Notre Dame students to volunteer
      in conjunction with local alumni groups. I chose to work in a Detroit parish and volunteered for various programs. I also helped overhaul the computer systems of an after school tutoring
      program as well as helped build two websites for Detroit parishes.

      <h1>Projects</h1>
      <p class="firstpara">
      Below are some of my current and past projects. Other ones I will be working on can be found at my <a href="https://github.com/alexmwu" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
        <a href="" target="_blank">dmr</a>: For <a href="https://2015.battlehack.org/chicago" target="_blank">Battlehack Chicago</a>, I decided to rethink one important aspect of the MapReduce
        distributed programming paradigm. Instead of sending mapper functions to cheap storage and processing nodes that are hard to maintain (including AWS's Elastic MapReduce in addition to
        traditional hardware), I thought that it might be cheaper and more scalable to send the mapper and the data to web devices. The logic is that almost all devices from phones to laptops
        browsing the web are using Javascript, so why not make them do some more work while browsing r/funny? Another incentive for this would be that website owners can make money on dmr jobs
        similar to ads. Meanwhile, those looking to do big data jobs can do so for cheaper and with less headache. A demo site with the given functionality and a dmr server is at the above link.
        As a side note, the name was originally Distributed MapReduce but was turned into the "dmr" acronym not only because it sounded better but also because it would be a tribute to Dennis
        Ritchie.
        </li>

        <li>
        <a href="http://www.alexmwu.me/modelviewer" target="_blank" class="wip">Model Viewer</a>: This project was for a Computer Graphics course to demonstrate 3D rendering techniques and
        get experience with the full rendering pipeline. It is written in Javascript and WebGL, so it should display in any browser the supports WebGL.
        </li>

        <li>
        MongoDB Scalability: For my Cloud Computing course, my partner and I deployed MongoDB and Node.js on Amazon EC2 instances and developed a simple URL API to submit MongoDB requests. The
        end goal was to test MongoDB performance by vertical (different EC2 instance types) and horizontal (sharding) scaling. In order to effectively test the effects of heavy load, we used
        the HTCondor parallel computing framework to simulate many transactions at once.
        </li>

        <li>
        <a href="http://challengepost.com/software/carefree" target="_blank">CareFree</a>: For <a href="http://www.hackillinois.org/" target="_blank">HackIllinois</a>, my team developed
        an Android app that acts as a medical ID tag and also connects to hospitals and first responders for patients in need of care. The idea came from the fact that most people nowadays
        carry their phone everywhere. We decided to utilize this to devise an emergency response system that would allow first responders to know basic medical and personal information
        about the patient and be able to contact an emergency contact and administer aid accordingly. The submission won an award in Best Healthcare Hack.
        </li>

        <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/ahansen3/Cse20212" target="_blank">Pokémon</a>: A remake of Pokémon developed for Visual Studio and the X Window system written in C++ with the
        <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/" target="_blank">SDL graphics library</a>. My partner and I learned quite a bit about the benefits of object oriented programming and basic sprite
        graphics in doing this project; we also discovered the wonders of version control.
        </li>

        <li>
        This Website!: This website came out of a desire to learn CSS and Javascript (I had learned HTML earlier). It made sense to create a website while doing so and it's a work in progress
        so I will keep it updated. It's on GitHub as an public repo, if you want to <a href="https://github.com/alexmwu/alexmwu.github.io" target="_blank">check it out</a>.
